"""
Inert: Acts as decaying "fuel" for other states and facilitates resource transport (like forming rivers or nutrient streams).
Solid: Becomes more shelter-like, creating "dead zones" or protective barriers while exerting significant force on weaker states.
Mesophase: Mimics "life-in-progress," transitioning frequently and interacting with most states while remaining unstable.
Liquid: Highly mobile and adaptive, carrying resources and interacting with all states to create flow and structure.
Gas: Spreads signals and energy, enabling communication and environment-wide reactions.
Plasma: Acts as a "sun cell," causing transformations and high-energy disruptions, acting as the "peak" of interactions.
